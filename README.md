Python program that will go through a folder of songs and add the artists name in the meta data.

This program was created with 
- [Spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.16.1/?highlight=search#ids-uris-and-urls)
- [eyeD3](https://eyed3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#welcome-to-eyed3)

eyeD3 was giving me a bunch of `Lame tag CRC check failed` errors...
